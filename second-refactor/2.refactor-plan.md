# TLS Portal Refactor Plan

## Goal
Extract valuable patterns from the current implementation into documentation and ensure the project can be fully regenerated via scripts. Create a clean, maintainable architecture following agentic coding principles.

## Current State
Working with live `tls-portal/` project directory that needs refactoring.

## Strategy
1. **Classify** all current files using A/B/C/D methodology
2. **Extract** patterns from "C" files into documentation
3. **Clean** architecture by removing "D" files
4. **Verify** "A" files can be script-generated
5. **Archive** current state only after refactor is complete

## Success Criteria
- All valuable patterns captured in documentation
- Project can be fully regenerated from scripts
- No functionality lost
- Setup time remains under 30 minutes
- Clean git history
