# TLS Portal - Clean Architecture

A modular monolith client portal system with automatic subdomain generation for law firms.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
./scripts/init-all.sh   # Setup everything
./scripts/dev.sh        # Start development
```

See [docs/01-setup.md](docs/01-setup.md) for detailed setup instructions and prerequisites.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses a **modular monolith** architecture. See [docs/03-tech-stack.md](docs/03-tech-stack.md) for technology decisions and detailed architecture.

## ✨ Features

### Client Portal System
- **Automatic Subdomain Generation** - Each client gets a unique subdomain
  - Format: `[first 4 letters of last name][last 4 digits of mobile]`
  - Example: John Smith (212) 555-1234 → `smit1234.thelawshop.com`
- **Multi-tenant Architecture** - Complete data isolation between firms
- **Client Intake Forms** - Validated forms with phone number formatting
- **Firebase Integration** - Firestore for data, Auth for authentication

### Development Features
- **Hot Reloading** - Frontend and backend with auto-restart
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety with shared types
- **Firebase Emulators** - Local development without cloud costs
- **Centralized Configuration** - Shared libraries for scripts
- **Warning Suppression** - Clean console output during development
