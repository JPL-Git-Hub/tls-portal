# CRITICAL: Secret Request Interception

Before asking for ANY credential, API key, token, or secret:

1. **STOP** - Am I about to ask for a secret?
2. **CHECK** - Is this already in the conversation/files?
3. **REFERENCE** - "I see from [context] that..."
4. **APOLOGIZE** - "I was about to ask for X, but I found..."

Known values in this project:
- Firebase Project: the-law-shop-457607
- Service Account: /config/.secrets/firebase-service-account.json
- Stripe Keys: /config/.secrets/stripe-keys.env

NEVER ask for these without checking context first.
