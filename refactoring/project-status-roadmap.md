# TLS Portal - Project Status & Roadmap

## Current Status Report

### Project Overview
**Project**: Client portal system for law firms with automatic subdomain generation  
**Architecture**: TypeScript monorepo (React frontend, Express backend, shared types)  
**Status**: Early implementation phase with solid foundation

### âœ… Completed Components
- **Infrastructure**: Full development environment with Firebase emulators
- **Build System**: Working TypeScript compilation and module structure  
- **Core Feature**: Client intake form with subdomain generation (`smit1234.thelawshop.com`)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README, architecture docs, and development philosophy
- **Tooling**: Complete suite of development scripts (init, start, stop, deploy)
- **Testing Setup**: Manual test workflows and scripts

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Recent refactoring (cleanup of `second-refactor/` directory)
- Documentation improvements in new `refactoring/` directory

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React/Vite + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Express.js + TypeScript  
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Auth**: Firebase Authentication
- **Deployment**: Google Cloud Run (containerized)
- **Scale Target**: 5,000 total portals, 25 concurrent active

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Authentication (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Implement Firebase Authentication (login/logout/session management)
- [ ] Add subdomain routing logic (extract subdomain, route to correct client)
- [ ] Create client dashboard UI (basic info display)

### Phase 2: Access Control (1 week)
- [ ] Add role-based access (client vs lawyer vs admin)
- [ ] Create lawyer admin panel (view all clients)
- [ ] Implement protected routes

### Phase 3: Features (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Build document upload/download system
- [ ] Add email notifications (SendGrid/Firebase)
- [ ] Implement billing integration (Stripe)

### Phase 4: Production (3-5 days)
- [ ] Deploy to Google Cloud Run
- [ ] Configure domain and SSL
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

## Key Next Steps
1. **Start with authentication** - it blocks everything else
2. Focus on subdomain routing after auth is working
3. Build minimal client dashboard to validate the flow
4. Layer in additional features incrementally

## Development Philosophy
- Simple, pragmatic implementations
- 100-line file limit (with pragmatic exceptions)
- No unnecessary abstractions
- Focus on 30-minute to 4-hour chunks
- Boring, proven technology choices
