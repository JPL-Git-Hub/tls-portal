# Agentic Refactoring Guide

## Core Principle
**Only refactor when it makes the code simpler.** If a refactor adds complexity, abstraction, or confusion - don't do it.

## When to Refactor (The 3 Triggers)

### 1. Pain-Driven Refactoring
Refactor ONLY when you feel actual pain:
- You're copy-pasting the same code for the 3rd time
- A simple change requires updating 5+ files
- You can't understand your own code after 2 weeks
- A bug fix revealed a structural problem

### 2. Performance-Driven Refactoring
Refactor when measured (not imagined) performance issues:
- Actual user complaints about speed
- Measured API response times > 500ms
- Database queries taking > 100ms
- Bundle size affecting load time

### 3. Integration-Driven Refactoring
Refactor when adding new services:
- New service doesn't fit current structure
- Integration would duplicate significant code
- Clear pattern emerges from 3+ similar services

## When NOT to Refactor

❌ **Never refactor for:**
- "Better" architecture
- Future possibilities
- Industry "best practices"
- Code aesthetics
- What you learned in a blog post

## The Refactoring Process

### Step 1: Identify Pain (5 minutes)
Write down EXACTLY what hurts:
- "I have to update 6 files to add a field"
- "This function is 200 lines and I can't follow it"
- "Every new endpoint copies the same 30 lines"

### Step 2: Use Git History as Evidence (10 minutes)
Let git show you the real pain points:
```bash
# Files changed most frequently (top 10)
git log --pretty=format: --name-only | sort | uniq -c | sort -rg | head -10

# Files that change together (coupling)
git log --format='' --name-only | grep -v '^$' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

# Recent refactoring attempts (what didn't work)
git log --grep="refactor" --oneline
```

If a file appears in 5+ commits for the same feature, it's a refactoring candidate.

### Step 3: Measure Impact (5 minutes)
Count the concrete cost:
- How many files affected?
- How many lines duplicated?
- How many minutes wasted each time?

### Step 4: Design Simplification (15 minutes)
The refactor MUST:
- Reduce total lines of code
- Reduce number of files
- Make the next change easier
- Be explainable in one sentence

### Step 5: Execute in Chunks (30-minute blocks)
- One refactor type per commit
- Keep the app working after each commit
- Test the specific pain point after each change

## Refactoring Patterns for Services

### Pattern 1: Extract Shared Logic
**When:** Same validation/formatting in 3+ places
**How:** Move to shared utils, not abstract classes
```typescript
// Before: Copied in every service
const formatPhone = (phone) => { /* 10 lines */ }

// After: In shared/utils
export { formatPhone } from '@tls-portal/shared'
```

### Pattern 2: Standardize Service Structure
**When:** Services have different patterns
**How:** Copy the simplest working pattern
```typescript
// Standard service structure (keep it boring)
src/[service-name]/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── routes/    # Express routes
  │   ├── services/  # Business logic
  │   ├── types/     # TypeScript types
  │   └── server.ts  # Entry point
  └── package.json
```

### Pattern 3: Consolidate Configuration
**When:** Same config repeated across services
**How:** Environment variables + shared config
```typescript
// Before: Hardcoded in each service
const TIMEOUT = 30000

// After: From environment
const TIMEOUT = process.env.SERVICE_TIMEOUT || 30000
```

## Documentation During Refactoring

### Document Patterns, Not Code
When refactoring reveals a pattern, document:
- **The Problem:** What pain did you hit?
- **The Solution:** What pattern fixed it?
- **The Gotcha:** What surprised you?

Example:
```markdown
## Firebase Emulator Connection Pattern
**Problem:** Services failing in dev with credential errors
**Solution:** Set FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST before Firebase init
**Gotcha:** Must be set before ANY Firebase import
```

### Skip the Obvious
Don't document:
- How React works
- What Express middleware does
- Standard TypeScript patterns
- Anything Google can answer

## Refactoring Checklist

Before starting any refactor:
- [ ] Can I explain the pain in one sentence?
- [ ] Will this reduce total complexity?
- [ ] Can I complete it in under 4 hours?
- [ ] Will a junior dev understand the result?

During refactoring:
- [ ] App stays functional after each commit
- [ ] Each commit does one type of change
- [ ] No new dependencies added
- [ ] No new abstractions created

After refactoring:
- [ ] Fewer files OR fewer lines (ideally both)
- [ ] The specific pain is gone
- [ ] No new pain introduced
- [ ] One-sentence explanation ready

## Service Addition Guide

When adding new services (auth, billing, etc.):

### 1. Copy Closest Example
- Find the most similar existing service
- Copy its entire structure
- Modify only what's different

### 2. Share Obvious Code
- Validation? → shared/utils
- Types? → shared/types  
- Config? → Environment variables

### 3. Resist Abstraction
- No service base classes
- No plugin architectures
- No clever generators
- Just boring, working code

### 4. Document Surprises Only
- Integration quirks
- Non-obvious config
- Actual gotchas hit
- Skip the rest

## The Final Test

After any refactor, you should be able to say:

> "I refactored [specific thing] because [specific pain]. Now [specific improvement]. It's simpler because [fewer files/lines/steps]."

If you can't fill in ALL those blanks with concrete specifics, you probably added complexity instead of removing it.

**Remember:** The best refactor is the one that makes future-you say "oh, that's obvious" not "wow, that's clever".
