# Refactoring Guidelines

## Quick Reference
- **REFACTORING_GUIDE.md** - Primary guidelines for all refactoring decisions
- **0.implementation-patterns.md** - Service-agnostic patterns that emerge during development

## Philosophy
Only refactor when it makes code simpler. Follow the 3 triggers: Pain-driven, Performance-driven, or Integration-driven.

## Usage
Before any refactor, read REFACTORING_GUIDE.md and check the relevant patterns. If you can't explain the refactor in one sentence, don't do it.
