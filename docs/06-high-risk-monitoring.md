# High-Risk Monitoring and AI Alerting

## Overview

This document outlines the planned high-risk monitoring system that will use AI (Claude) to analyze and alert on critical security, performance, and code quality issues.

## Purpose

Automatically detect and alert on high-risk situations before they impact production, including:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Critical code issues
- Performance problems
- Compliance violations

## High-Risk Scenarios

### 1. Security Risks
- **Exposed Secrets**: API keys, passwords, tokens in code
- **Authentication Issues**: TODOs in auth code, bypass patterns
- **Injection Vulnerabilities**: SQL injection, XSS possibilities
- **Insecure Dependencies**: Known vulnerabilities in packages

### 2. Production Risks
- **Debug Code**: Console.logs, debugger statements
- **Error Handling**: Unhandled promises, missing try-catch
- **Performance**: Memory leaks, infinite loops
- **Database**: Failed migrations, connection issues

### 3. Code Quality Risks
- **Critical TODOs**: In payment, auth, or security code
- **Breaking Changes**: API compatibility issues
- **Deprecated Code**: Using sunset features
- **Missing Tests**: Uncovered critical paths

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Detection Scripts
```bash
# Location: /scripts/risk-monitor.sh
# Checks for various risk patterns
# Outputs structured JSON report
```

### Phase 2: AI Analysis
```javascript
// MCP server integration
// Claude analyzes risk patterns
// Determines severity levels
// Suggests immediate fixes
```

### Phase 3: Alerting
- Email notifications for critical issues
- Slack/Discord webhooks for team alerts
- GitHub Issues for tracking
- Dashboard for monitoring trends

## Risk Patterns

### Secrets Detection
```bash
# Pattern examples:
grep -E "api_key|secret|password|token" --exclude-dir=node_modules
grep -E "sk_live|pk_live" # Stripe production keys
grep -E "mongodb://|postgres://" # Database URLs
```

### Auth/Security TODOs
```bash
# Critical TODOs in sensitive areas:
grep -r "TODO.*auth" src/
grep -r "TODO.*security" src/
grep -r "TODO.*password" src/
```

### Production Code Issues
```bash
# Debug code that shouldn't be in production:
grep -r "console.log" src/
grep -r "debugger" src/
grep -r "localhost" src/
```

## Alert Levels

### üî¥ Critical (Immediate Action)
- Exposed production secrets
- Authentication bypasses
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Payment processing issues

### üü° Warning (Action Required)
- TODOs in security code
- Deprecated dependencies
- Missing error handling
- Performance issues

### üîµ Info (Monitor)
- Code quality issues
- Test coverage gaps
- Documentation needs
- Technical debt

## Integration with Claude

### MCP Server Configuration
```json
{
  "riskMonitor": {
    "command": "./scripts/risk-monitor.sh",
    "schedule": "hourly",
    "alertThreshold": "warning",
    "notificationChannels": ["email", "slack"]
  }
}
```

### AI Analysis Prompts
```
Analyze this risk report and:
1. Determine severity level
2. Identify immediate actions needed
3. Suggest code fixes
4. Assess potential impact
```

## Notification Templates

### Critical Alert
```
üö® CRITICAL SECURITY RISK DETECTED

Type: [Risk Type]
Location: [File:Line]
Impact: [Description]
Recommended Action: [Immediate steps]

This requires immediate attention.
```

### Warning Alert
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Potential Risk Detected

Type: [Risk Type]  
Location: [File:Line]
Severity: Medium
Suggested Fix: [Recommendations]
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning**: Train on historical issues to predict problems
2. **Auto-Remediation**: Automatically fix certain issues
3. **Trend Analysis**: Track risk patterns over time
4. **Integration**: Connect with CI/CD pipeline
5. **Custom Rules**: Project-specific risk patterns

## Configuration

### Risk Monitor Config
```yaml
# .risk-monitor.yml
rules:
  secrets:
    enabled: true
    patterns:
      - 'api_key'
      - 'secret'
      - 'password'
    exclude:
      - 'test/'
      - 'mock/'
  
  todos:
    critical_paths:
      - 'auth/'
      - 'payment/'
      - 'security/'
    
  production:
    forbidden:
      - 'console.log'
      - 'debugger'
      - 'localhost'

alerts:
  critical:
    channels: ['email', 'slack', 'pagerduty']
  warning:
    channels: ['slack', 'github']
  info:
    channels: ['dashboard']
```

## Testing the System

1. **Inject Test Risks**: Add known patterns to test detection
2. **Verify Alerts**: Ensure notifications work correctly
3. **Test AI Analysis**: Validate Claude's risk assessment
4. **Check False Positives**: Tune patterns to reduce noise

## Metrics and Monitoring

- **Detection Rate**: Risks caught before production
- **False Positive Rate**: Accuracy of alerts
- **Response Time**: Time to fix after alert
- **Risk Trends**: Patterns over time

## Conclusion

This high-risk monitoring system will provide an AI-powered safety net for the codebase, catching critical issues before they impact users or security. By integrating with Claude through MCP, we get intelligent analysis and actionable recommendations for each risk detected.
