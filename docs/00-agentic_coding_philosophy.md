# Agentic Coding Philosophy ‚Äî TLS Portal

## Core Philosophy & Vision

This project follows an **intentionally lightweight and clean architecture that prioritizes maintainability and efficiency over unnecessary complexity**. We build production-capable systems through simplicity, not complexity.

### What We Embrace

- **Clarity over Cleverness** - Code that explains itself without documentation
- **Explicit over Implicit** - Direct paths with no hidden magic
- **Boring Technology** - Proven tools that just work
- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)** - Build only what's needed now
- **Single Responsibility** - Each piece does one thing well
- **30-Minute Chunks** - Everything should be achievable in focused bursts

## Quick Decision Guide

### ‚úÖ Green Light - Go Ahead If:
- Implementation takes under 100 lines
- Single, clear purpose
- No new dependencies needed
- Follows existing project patterns
- Can be done in 30 minutes to 4 hours

**Exception for Init Scripts:** Initialization scripts that create complete, working modules may exceed 100 lines when breaking them apart would create unnecessary orchestration complexity. The goal is working functionality, not arbitrary line limits. A 200-line script that gives you a complete working backend is simpler than three 70-line scripts that must be run in sequence.

**The real test:** Ask "Does this make the project simpler?" If one longer script eliminates complexity and gets you to working code faster, choose the longer script.

### üõë Red Flag - Stop If:
- Needs extensive documentation to understand
- Requires learning new tools or frameworks
- Adds configuration files or abstractions
- Uses enterprise patterns (DI, factories, etc.)
- Takes more than a day to implement

### ‚ö° Quick Check:
**Before suggesting ANY improvement, ask:**
1. Does this add complexity? (If yes ‚Üí reject)
2. Does this require new tools? (If yes ‚Üí reject)
3. Takes more than 4 hours? (If yes ‚Üí reject)
4. Would a junior understand immediately? (If no ‚Üí reject)

## Production Requirements

This system MUST handle:
- 5,000 total client portals
- Up to 25 portals active simultaneously
- Production-grade security and reliability
- Single-container deployment to Google Cloud Run
- Multi-tenant data isolation

**But achieve this through simple, well-designed architecture** - not complex enterprise patterns.

## What We DO: Patterns & Examples

### Good Pattern (from our actual codebase):
```bash
# Simple idempotency using marker files
marker="$project_root/$MARKER_DIR/structure.done"
if is_completed "$marker" && ! is_force "$@"; then
    log_warn "Structure already initialized. Use --force to recreate."
    return 0
fi
```

### Simple Improvements We Support:
- Basic idempotency markers (touch .done files)
- Consolidating duplicate code into simple functions
- Moving files to logical locations without complex hierarchies
- Creating simple templates with variable substitution
- Basic validation with clear error messages
- Simple logging with echo/printf
- Straightforward bash functions under 20 lines

### Real Examples from This Project:
```bash
# Good: Simple utility function
log_success() {
    echo -e "${GREEN}‚úì $1${NC}"
}

# Good: Direct file creation
cat > "$file" << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "@tls-portal/shared",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
EOF

# Good: Clear, simple check
if ! command -v node >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    die "Node.js is required but not installed"
fi
```

## What We DON'T DO: Explicit Constraints

### Never Suggest:
- Testing frameworks beyond minimal existing setup
- Complex CI/CD pipelines (simple GitHub Actions are acceptable with Claude GitHub App)
- Manifest files or complex YAML orchestration
- Complex directory restructuring
- Multi-day implementation timelines
- Enterprise patterns (dependency injection, factories)
- Comprehensive error handling frameworks
- Logging frameworks beyond echo statements
- Configuration management systems
- Mock frameworks or test fixtures
- Documentation generation tools
- Additional package managers beyond yarn
- Container orchestration
- Microservice patterns
- Database migration frameworks
- ORM or query builders

### Violation Phrases to Avoid:
- "comprehensive testing strategy"
- "robust error handling"
- "enterprise-grade"
- "complex CI/CD pipeline" (simple Claude GitHub App automation is fine)
- "over-engineered deployment pipeline"
- "monitoring and observability framework"
- "scalable architecture"
- "microservices approach"
- "best practices" (when adding complexity)

## For AI Assistants

When working on this project:

1. **Default to "no"** for new suggestions
2. **Look for existing patterns first** - we probably already have a simple solution
3. **Suggest inline solutions**, not abstractions
4. **Time-box everything** to 30-minute chunks
5. **If explaining takes longer than coding**, it's too complex

### Good AI Responses:
- "Let's just move these 3 files and update the imports."
- "Add a simple check: `if [[ -f .done ]]; then exit 0; fi`"
- "Combine these duplicate functions into one 10-line helper."
- "Copy this existing pattern from init-structure.sh"

### Bad AI Responses:
- "Implement a comprehensive testing strategy with..."
- "Create a robust error handling framework..."
- "Set up a complex CI/CD pipeline with multiple stages..."
- "Let's refactor this into a proper abstraction layer..."

### Acceptable Automation:
- Claude GitHub App for AI-assisted code reviews
- Simple GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Automated workflows that enhance developer productivity without adding complexity

## Success Metrics

A good solution in this project:
- ‚úì Can be implemented in one sitting (30 min - 4 hours)
- ‚úì Requires zero additional documentation
- ‚úì Uses only existing dependencies
- ‚úì Follows established patterns from the codebase
- ‚úì Could be explained to a junior developer in 5 minutes
- ‚úì Solves the immediate problem without anticipating future needs

## Decision Framework Examples

### Scenario: "We need better error handling"
‚ùå **Wrong**: Create an error handling framework with custom error classes
‚úÖ **Right**: Add simple `|| die "Clear error message"` to critical commands

### Scenario: "Scripts need better organization"
‚ùå **Wrong**: Create scripts/modules/, scripts/utils/, scripts/tests/ hierarchy
‚úÖ **Right**: Keep flat structure, use clear naming like init-*.sh

### Scenario: "Need to ensure idempotency"
‚ùå **Wrong**: Build a state management system with dependency graphs
‚úÖ **Right**: Use simple .done marker files in .init/ directory

## Summary

This is a **minimalist yet production-capable project**. Every decision must answer: "Does this make the project simpler?" 

We're building a production-ready system that:
- Handles 5,000 client portals reliably
- Can be understood and maintained by one developer
- Uses boring, proven technology
- Achieves complexity through composition, not abstraction

**Remember**: The best code is often the code you don't write.
